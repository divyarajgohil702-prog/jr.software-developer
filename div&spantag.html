                             Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a poor boy named Aarav. He was kind-hearted and always
                            helped others, even though he had very little for himself.

                        <p>
                                  One hot afternoon, Aarav saw an old man sitting by the road, tired and thirsty. Without thinking twice,
                                  Aarav gave him his only bottle of water. The old man smiled and thanked him warmly.

                             Days later, the village faced a hard time. Crops failed, and many people were worried. One morning, a group
                             of helpers arrived with food and seeds. Leading them was the same old man Aarav had helped. He was a
                            traveler
                             who helped villages in need.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                             Because of Aarav’s kindness, the village was saved. Everyone realized that even a small good deed can bring
                             big happiness.
